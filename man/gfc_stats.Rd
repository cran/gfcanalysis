\title{Produce a table of forest cover change statistics for a given AOI}
\usage{
gfc_stats(aoi, gfc, scale_factor = 1e-04)
}
\arguments{
\item{aoi}{one or more Area of Interest (AOI) polygon(s) as a
\code{SpatialPolygons*} object. See Details.}

\item{gfc}{extract of GFC product for a given AOI (see
\code{\link{extract_gfc}}), recoded using \code{\link{threshold_gfc}}.}

\item{scale_factor}{how to scale the output data (from meters). Defaults to
.0001 for output in hectares.}
}
\value{
\code{list} with two elements "loss_table", a \code{data.frame} with
statistics on forest loss, and "gain_table", with the area of forest gain,
and area that experienced both loss and gain. The units of the output are
hectares (when \code{scale_factor} is set to .0001).
}
\description{
For a given AOI, this function produces two tables: an annual forest loss
table (in hectares, by default), and a table specifying 1) the total area of
pixels that experienced forest gain and, 2) the total area of pixels that
experienced both loss and gain over the full 2010-2012 period. Note that
forest gain and combined loss and gain are not available in the GFC product
on an annualized basis. Use \code{\link{extract_gfc}} to extract the GFC
data for the AOI, and threshold it using \code{\link{threshold_gfc}} prior to
running this function.
}
\details{
If the\code{aoi} \code{SpatialPolygons*} object is not in the coordinate
system of \code{gfc}, it will be reprojected. If there is a "label"
attribute, it will be used to label the output statistics.  Otherwise,
unique names ("AOI 1", "AOI 2", etc.) will be generated and used to label
the output. If multiple AOIs share the same labels, statistics will be
provided for the union of these AOIs.
