\title{Generate an annual stack of forest change from GFC product}
\usage{
annual_stack(gfc)
}
\arguments{
  \item{gfc}{thresholded extract of GFC product for a given
  AOI (see \code{\link{threshold_gfc}})}
}
\description{
Uses thresholded GFC data as output by
\code{\link{threshold_gfc}} to make an annualized layer
stack of forest change. See Details for the class codes
used in the annual raster stack. The
\code{\link{animate_annual}} function can be used to
produce an animation of forest change from the generated
layer stack.
}
\details{
The output raster stack uses the following codes to
describe forest change at each pixel: \tabular{lc}{ Nodata
\tab 0 \cr Forest \tab 1 \cr Non-forest \tab 2 \cr Forest
loss \tab 3 \cr Forest gain \tab 4 \cr Forest loss and gain
\tab 5 \cr Water \tab 6 \cr }
